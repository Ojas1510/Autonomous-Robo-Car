# Autonomous-Robo-Car

This creates an autonomous vehicle that can be wirelessly controlled from a remote station and safely operates alongside other vehicles. 
It involves designing and implementing a micro-simulation of a lightweight rail system, similar to urban trams. 
The main challenge addressed in this project is the design and integration of electronic systems. By developing a comprehensive solution, the project aims to ensure efficient and reliable control of the autonomous vehicle. 
The micro-simulation provides a virtual environment to test different control strategies and communication protocols, ensuring the vehicle's safe coexistence with other vehicles.
Ultimately, the project aims to advance electronic systems in autonomous vehicles, contributing to the improvement of future transportation systems' safety and efficiency.
